# physiotherapyPatientScheduling
A simple program to address a problem from a doctoral student of physiotherapy who needs to schedule sessions (considering several constraints) for a research


Work still in progress. Currently I'm (in order of priority):

- Improving the mathematical definition
- Trying to implement some prototype of the mathematical model
- Implement portuguese-english dialog messages
- Review the quality of the code

Some characteristics of the problem are "hardcoded".
It is expected that soon some of them are going to be set as parameters

If you are researching a similar problem, feel free to send me a e-mail so we can share different formulations and methods

Thanks :)
